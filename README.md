## Booleans
A boolean is a value that can either be true or false. Booleans are a new data type, adding to your existing knowledge of integers, floats, and strings in Python. 

For example, here are two boolean variables:

```python

Note the following about the above variable declaration:
- Booleans are special values that must begin with a capital letter, e.g. `True` and `False`.
- Booleans do not use quotes. 

## If Statements
Thus far, we have been writing sequential programs. These are programs that run linearly, step-by-step, from start to finish. A sequential program might look something like this:

Programs often need to do different things based on circumstances. This leads us to a programming concept known as **selection**, which might look something like this: 

<img src="images/selection.png" alt="sequential" height="350px" />
